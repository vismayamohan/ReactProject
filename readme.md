## Class 1

#### What is emmet?
- Emment is designed to speedup the process of writing and editing code by providing a set of shortcuts that can be quickly expandable to full code blocks. It is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allow for high-speed coding and editing in structured code format via content assist.

#### What is cross-origin?
- CORS is a mechanism which uses additional HTTP headers to tell the browser wheather a specific web app can share resource with another webapp. So both the webapp should have different origin. So if they have the same origin then it is easy to share resourses, but if not then they need to follow the CORS mechanism.


## Class 2

#### What is NPM?
- NPM is a package manager for JS programming language and maintained by node. It is world's largest software registry. NPM is very easy to use we can install any software package for free. It is free to use and we can create private software package as well, many companies use them. NPM is dependend on node.js NPM helps in creating config file for our project which will help to run our project. NPM creates a package.json file which consists of all the configuration.

#### What is parcel/Webpack? Why do we need it?
- Parcel/Webpack are bundlers which helps in running the project on browser. Bundler is a devlopement tool that combine many javascript files into a single one that is production ready loadable in browser. There are many reasons why we need bundlers some of them are.
--> It is an optimizing technique we can use to reduce the number of server requests for javascript files.


#### What is .parcel-cache
- Parcel-cache folder stores information about our project when parcel builds it, so that when it rebuilds, it does not have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. This is one of the reason why parcel can be very fast in development mode. We should add this in git-ignore becasuse it is the space taken by parcel during production building its binary files. This can be made again after deleting cache with a command npm run build. This is where parcel helps our project and do all the extra work for our application.

#### What is npx?
- NPX is node package execute. NPX is used to execute JS packages. NPX means execute using NPM.

#### What is the differnece between dependencies and devDependencies?
- In every application there is a file called as package.json. This file containes all the relavent data regarding the project. 
--> Dependencies: It consists of all the packages that are used in the project with the version number. 
--> devDependencies: It consists of all the packages that are used in the project development phase and not in the production or testing environment.
--> Global Dependencies: In global dependencies it installs the current package context as global package. It allows us to use the code in the package as a set of tools on our local computer.
#### What is tree shaking?
- Tree shaking is when there are dead code present in our application it will help us removing the same. Parcel helps in automatically remove dead code when bundling multiple files into single file. This is important for preparing code that is production ready with clean structures and minimal file size.

#### What is hot module replacement.
- Hot module replacement exchanges, adds or removes modules while an application is running, without a full reload. This can significantly speed up development by retaining application state which is lost during full reload. Save development time by only updating what's changed. Instantly update the browser when modifications are made to CSS/JS and many more.


#### List down your favourite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words.
- Minifying
- Bundling
- File watcher algorithm
- Port Number
- Zero Config

- Minifying - parcel minifies the file by reducing the file size of output bundles by removing whitespace, renaming variables or shorter names and many other optimizations.
- Port Number - Parcel handles port number. It gives us a port in which our project is being hoisted.
- Zero Config - Parcel is zero config meaning we do not have to config anything sepeartly. Parcel handles everything and no aditional config is needed. It will install all the necessary plugins and dependencies for the project.

#### What is .gitignore? What should we add and not add into it?
- In git-ignore we add files which need not be added to git. We add files which are auto generated or can be generated in server into git-ignore. Our main file should go inside git like main web pages and package.json, package-lock.json files and all others which are needed for a project to run.

#### What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json
- package.json consists of all the config (metadata) details of the project which can be edited like the root and other like stylesheets.
- Package-lock.json this is the main config file where in all the modules are defined and are locked for the dependency version we should not edit anything in this file.
- package.json is a versioning file used to install multiple packages into your project. When we initialize node application we will see three files installed in our application those are package.json, package-lock.json and node_modules. package.json file contains metadata about the project and also the functional dependencies that is required for the application. It consists of the basic information about the project. It contains information such as name, description, author, script, and dependencies.	
- package-lock.json file is created to lock the dependency with the installed version. It will install the exact latest version of the package in our application and save the same in package.json. It describes the exact tree that was generated to allow subsequent installs to have the identical tree. It allows future devs to install the same dependencies in the project. It contains the name, dependencies, and locked version of the project. 

#### Why should I not modify package-lock.json?
- Package-lock.json file are generated file and is not generated to be manually edited. Its purpose is to track the entire tree of dependencies (including dependencies of dependencies) and exact version of each dependencies.


#### What is node_modules? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
- Node module are some code which has already been written and we can use the same in our project. Node module provide a way to re-use code in our project. Yes node_modules should be in git ignore, as package.json has sufficient information to recreate node modules. As it keeps all the track of data information in package.lock and package.json files we can generate the same node modules in the server. And the same packega-lock file will help us generate node modules in our server.

#### What is dist folder?
- Dist folder basically keeps the file minified to us. Its keeps all the file minified and when we create a development build of our application parcel will buid all the production files into .dist folder.

#### What are browserlist?
- Browserlist is a thing which will make our code compatiable for a lot of browsers. We need to config browserlist inside package.json file. It will require to pass last versions that our application to support. So we will have to pass 'last two verions' and parcel will make sure that our application will work in all the browsers available for the last two versions.

#### What is Ë† - carat and ~ - tilda ?
- Using a caret (^) sign means that we can accept minor releases and patch releases, but not a major release when updating our package. Using a tilde sign before our version number means that we can accept only a patch release when updating our package. 


## Class 3

### What is JSX?
- JSX is nothing but javascript XML (extensible markup language). It is not HTML inside javascript, but it is HTML like syntax. JSX allows us to describe React's object tree using a syntax that resembles that of an HTML template. 

### Superpowers of JSX
- We can write javascript inside JSX, it is easy to maintain, we can debug easily. We can write logic and HTML in a single file.

### Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?
- Type attribute specifies the type of the script. The default value is text/javascript.

### {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent />} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX
- {TitleComponent}: TitleComponent is javascript variable or a JS expression. Curly braces is used to call a variable inside JSX.
- <TitleComponent />: This is a React component which is returning some JSX value inside another component or render this component. This is a function component that returns a JSX value. A value which is inside angular bracket with closing tag is component.
- <TitleComponent></TitleComponent>: This is equal to <TitleComponent />. We write in this way when there are no component composition. But when another component is called inside current component we write in this way.


## Class 4

### Is JSX mandatory for React?
- No JSx is not mandatory for React. JSX is an extension syntax that allows writing HTML and JS together easily in React and is used to create React elements. These elements are then rendered to the React DOM. JSX elements is just to make use of React easy and for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children) with less code. So, anything that is done with JSX can also be done with plain javascript. JSX is not mandatory but is used for writing better and clean code instead of writing code using React.createElement.
Ex: 
`var header = <h1>Hello World!</h1>;`

### IS ES6 mandatory for React?
- ES6 is not mandatory for React but is highly recommendable. The latest projects created on React rely a lot on ES6. React uses ES6 and you should be familiar with some of the new features. 

### {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>} in JSX?
-  The Difference is stated below:
{TitleComponent}: This value describes the TitleComponent as a javascript expression or a variable or React element. The {} can embed a javascript expression or a variable or React element inside it.
<TitleComponent/> : This value represents a Component that is basically returning Some JSX value. In simple terms TitleComponent a function that is returning a JSX value. If component is written inside the {<  />} expression.
<TitleComponent></TitleComponent> : <TitleComponent /> and <TitleComponent></TitleComponent> are equivalent only when < TitleComponent /> has no child components. The opening and closing tags are created to include the child components.

Example:
`<TitleComponent>
    <FirstChildComponent />
    <SecondChildComponent />
    <ThirdChildComponent />
</TitleComponent>`

### How can I write comments in JSX?
- {/* */} - for single and miltiple lines comments.

### What is <React.Fragment></React.Fragment> and <></>?
- `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` is a feature in React that allows you to return multiple elements from a React component by allowing you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. `<></>` is the shorthand tag for `React.Fragment` . The only difference between them is that the shorthand version does not support the key attribute.

### What is virtual DOM?
- Virtual DOM is a light weight abstraction of DOM. You can think of it as a copy of DOM, that can be updated without affecting the actual DOM. It has all the same properties as the real DOM Object, but does not have the ability to write to the screen like the real DOM. Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do the changes in the blueprint but those changes will not directly apply to the machine. Reconcillation is the process to compare and keep in sync the two files. i.e. the real and the virtual DOM. Diffing algorithm is a technique of reconciliation which is used by React.

### What is reconcillation in React?
- Reconcillation is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use  diffing algorithm so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the real DOM and the copy of DOM (Virtual DOM) when there's an update of components. React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called Virtual DOM. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. Comparison is done by Diffing Algorithm. React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called Reconciliation.

### What is React Fiber?
- React fiber is the concept of ReactJS that is used to render a system faster, smoother and smarter. The Fiber reconciler, which became the default reconciler for React 16 and above, is a complete rewrite of Reactâ€™s reconciliation algorithm to solve some long-standing issues in React. Because Fiber is asynchronous, React can:
-- Pause, resume, and restart rendering work on components as new updates come in
-- Reuse previously completed work and even abort it if not needed
-- Split work into chunks and prioritize tasks based on importance

### Why do we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?
- A key is a special attribute you need to include when creating list of elements in React. Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are unique Identifier used to give an identity to the elements in the lists. Keys should be given to the elements within the array to give the elements a stable identity.
Example
`<li key={0}>1</li>
<li key={1}>2</li>
<li key={2}>3</li>`

### Can we use index as keys in React?
- Yes, we can use index as keys in React, but it is not considered as a good practice to use them because is the order of items change.This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. Keys are taken from each object which is being rendered. There might be a possibility that if we modify the incoming data react may render them in unusual order.

### What is props in React? Ways to?
- props stands for properties. Props are arguments passed into React components. props are used in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)). They are useful when you want the flow of data in your app to be dynamic.
Example
`function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Tool name="Chetan Nada" tool="Figma"/> // name and tool are props
    </div>
  )
}`

### What is config driven UI?
- Config Driven UI are based on the configurations of the data application receives. It is rather a good practice to use config driven UIs to make application for dynamic. It is a very common & basic approach to interact with the User. It provides a generic interface to develop things which help your project scale well. It saves a lot of development time and effort. A typical login form, common in most of the Apps. Most of these forms also get frequent updates as the requirements increase in terms of Form Validations, dropdown options,.. or design changes.

### Difference between Virtual DOM and Real DOM?
A: DOM stands for Document Object Model, which represents your application UI and whenever the changes are made in the application, this DOM gets updated and the user is able to visualize the changes. DOM is an interface that allows scripts to update the content, style, and structure of the document.

Virtual DOM
The Virtual DOM is a light-weight abstraction of the DOM. You can think of it as a copy of the DOM, that can be updated without affecting the actual DOM. It has all the same properties as the real DOM object, but doesnâ€™t have the ability to write to the screen like the real DOM.
Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do the changes in the blueprint but those changes will not directly apply to the machine.
Reconciliation is a process to compare and keep in sync the two files (Real and Virtual DOM). Diffing algorithm is a technique of reconciliation which is used by React.
Real DOM
The DOM represents the web page often called a document with a logical tree and each branch of the tree ends in a node and each node contains object programmers can modify the content of the document using a scripting language like javascript and the changes and updates to the dom are fast because of its tree-like structure but after changes, the updated element and its children have to be re-rendered to update the application UI so the re-rendering of the UI which make the dom slow all the UI components you need to be rendered for every dom update so real dom would render the entire list and not only those item that receives the update .
|Real DOM	| Virtual DOM |
----------|--------------
|DOM manipulation is very expensive	|DOM manipulation is very easy|
|There is too much memory wastage	|No memory wastage|
|It updates Slow	|It updates fast|
|It can directly update HTML	|It canâ€™t update HTML directly|
|Creates a new DOM if the element updates.	|Update the JSX if the element update|
|It allows us to directly target any specific node (HTML element)|	It can produce about 200,000 Virtual DOM Nodes / Second.|
|It represents the UI of your application	|It is only a virtual representation of the DOM|
